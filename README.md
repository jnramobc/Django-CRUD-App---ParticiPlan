Description
Participlan is a volunteer and event management platform designed to streamline the process of organizing and tracking volunteers for community events. With Participlan, users can create events, manage volunteers, and track participations. This app simplifies event coordination, making it easier to manage large groups of volunteers across multiple events.

The project was built to help community organizers keep track of their volunteers and events in one place. Participlan's goal is to make volunteer management more efficient and transparent.
